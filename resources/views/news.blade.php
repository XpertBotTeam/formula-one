        Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner has addressed reports that Colton Herta could be in line for a seat at sister team AlphaTauri in 2023, with current driver Pierre Gasly being linked with a move to Alpine for next season.

Gasly is contracted to AlphaTauri until the end of 2023 but recent reports have emerged that IndyCar racer Herta, who tested for McLaren earlier this season, could replace the Frenchman – to enable Gasly to leave the team, perhaps to join Alpine when Fernando Alonso leaves for Aston Martin.

Neither Horner nor AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost have confirmed those reports, however, when pressed on the issue Horner said: “Look, he [Gasly] is a Red Bull Racing driver on loan to AlphaTauri. There’s a lot of moving plates at the moment, which we follow with interest. We’ll see how it pans out, there’s a few moving plates.”
